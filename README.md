# Rust-NextJS-TODO-APP
Just a small TODO app to practice creating a rust backend and revisiting Next.js as a front end


## Usage instructions

1. To run the backend go to the rust folder and run the following command

```bash
cargo run
```

2. To run the front end go to the root project folder and run the following command(s):

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

p.s. This project is just some syntax practice (nothing fancy ðŸ‘€). Why would a freakin TODO app need any concurrency management and some crazy performance rust!? ðŸ™ƒ
